    <b>rc.eduserver</b> - server control utility.

    Usage: <b>rc.eduserver</b> {start|stop|restart|reload}

      The server 'eduserver' program is scheduled to be automatically executed
    during system startup. But there may be situations when you will want to
    manually control the server. Mainly, when you will make a change on college
    password database (using any of the utilities available), you must tell
    the server to re-load the password database using the 'reload' option of
    the script.

    <b>Options</b>

    <i>start</i>   - runs a new instance of the server. never do this unless
	      you know what you are doing. you may use this option only if
	      you have manually stopped the server using the 'stop' option
              of this script.
    <i>stop</i>    - stops the running server process. all connections will be
              closed. clients will receive FIN.
    <i>restart</i> - restarts the server process. it just stops the running
              server and then starts it again.
    <i>reload</i>  - reload the password database. it makes the server re-read
              the password database. you will need to do this after a
              modification of the server password database using any
              of the password database management utilities.

    All other options are ignored.

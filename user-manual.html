    System requirements: Windows 98 or later version, CD-ROM drive.<br>
    Follow the steps to use the software:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Insert the CD in the CD-ROM drive. The CD will automatically run the
      program from the CD.<br>
      (If this is not the case for you, see the NOTE section below)
      </li>

      then vanish away. Then a window with two option buttons will arrive.
      Select your appropriate choice for registration and click the 'Go'
      button.
      </li>
      <li>A query window will appear before you. This window contains two
      entry boxes. Enter your appropriate session in the box labeled 'Enter
      Session'. Note that the program may automatically fill the rest of the
      session entry for your convenience. Then enter your institution code in
      the box labeled 'Enter Institution Code'. If you enter a valid
      institution code, and if it is found in the institution code database,
      then the name of the institution will be displayed just below the
      institution code. As soon as the name of institution is found in the
      database, a 'OK' button below the name of the institution will be
      visible. Click the button to see the registration form.
      </li>
      -------------------------------------------------<br>

      'Save' button. The form will be verified and it everything seems Ok, you
      will get a message saying that the form has been successfully saved.
      </li>
      <li>
      If the form is successfully saved, you can see an entry of this form in
      the 'Information Editor' window. You can edit already filled form by
      selecting it and clicking on the 'Edit' button of the "Information
      Editor" window.
      </li>

      You can save the current form and exit by clicking the 'Save and exit'
      button. If you want to discard entries filled in and exit, you can click
      'Exit without saving' button. If you try to close a window using the
      cross button (x) in the window title bar, the program will assume that
      you don't want to save modified information. The main registration form
      window will issue a warning message. If you are sure you want to discard
      changes, click 'Ok'.
      </li>

      issue a message before you.
      </li>
      <h2>Errors</h2>
      1. The following window may arrive.<br>
      <img src="screenshots/Message-window00.png"><br>
      This may be happening for one or more of the following reasons:
      1. You are not connected to the Internet<br>
      2. The server is not running in the Education Board<br>
      3. You may be behind a proxy or firewall.

      Solutions:<br>
      1. If you use dialup internet connection, run the dialer and connect to
      your internet service provider (ISP). If you are using broad band, the
      connection may be down or your 'Default Gateway' settings in the TCP/IP
      configuration may be wrong. Contact your system/network administrator
      for fixing this problem. If you still encounter the previous problem,
      go to next step.<br>
      2. Contact Education Board and make sure that their server is running.
      If that is not running, you can't send forms. If the server is running
      and still you get the previous error, go to next step.
      3. If you use a broadband connection, you might be behind a proxy server
      which is not allowing you to initiate a connection to the education
      board server. Contact your Broadband service provider for this problem.
      There may also be a firewall rule in your the Gateway machine of the
      Broadband service provider which might not allow you to initiate
      communication with the Education Board server.<br>
      4. If none of the above can fix your problem, write down the messages
      appeared before you and contact the Education Board Computer Center for
      the problem.

PPM2TIFF(1)                                         PPM2TIFF(1)





NAME
       ppm2tiff - create a TIFF file from a PPM image file

SYNOPSIS
       ppm2tiff [ options ] [ input.ppm ] output.tif

DESCRIPTION
       ppm2tiff  converts  a  file  in  the PPM image format to
       TIFF.  By default, the TIFF image is created  with  data
       samples  packed (PlanarConfiguration=1), compressed with
       the Lempel-Ziv & Welch  algorithm  (Compression=5),  and
       with each strip no more than 8 kilobytes.  These charac-
       teristics can be overriden, or explicitly specified with
       the options described below

       If the PPM file contains greyscale data, then the Photo-
       metricInterpretation tag is  set  to  1  (min-is-black),
       otherwise it is set to 2 (RGB).

       If  no  PPM  file  is  specified  on  the  command line,
       ppm2tiff will read from the standard input.

OPTIONS
       -c     Specify a compression scheme to use when  writing
              image  data: -c none for no compression, -c pack-
              bits for the PackBits compression algorithm  (the
              default),  -c jpeg for the baseline JPEG compres-
              sion algorithm, -c zip for the  Deflate  compres-
              sion algorithm, and -c lzw for Lempel-Ziv & Welch
              compression.

       -r     Write data with a specified number  of  rows  per
              strip;  by  default  the  number of rows/strip is
              selected so that each strip  is  approximately  8
              kilobytes.

       -R     Mark  the resultant image to have the specified X
              and Y resolution (in dots/inch).

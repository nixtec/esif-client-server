NAME
       tiffdump - print verbatim information about TIFF files

SYNOPSIS
       tiffdump [ options ] name ...

DESCRIPTION
       tiffdump  displays directory information from files cre-
       ated according to the Tag Image  File  Format,  Revision
       6.0.   The  header of each TIFF file (magic number, ver-
       sion, and first directory offset) is displayed, followed
       by  the tag contents of each directory in the file.  For
       each tag, the name, datatype,  count,  and  value(s)  is
       displayed.  When the symbolic name for a tag or datatype
       is known, the symbolic name  is  displayed  followed  by
       it's  numeric (decimal) value.  Tag values are displayed
       enclosed in ``<>'' characters  immediately  preceded  by
       the   value   of  the  count  field.   For  example,  an
       ImageWidth tag might be displayed as ``ImageWidth  (256)
       SHORT (3) 1<800>''.

       tiffdump  is  particularly  useful for investigating the
       contents of TIFF files that libtiff does not understand.

OPTIONS
       -h     Force  numeric  data to be printed in hexadecimal
              rather than the default decimal.

       -o     Dump the contents of the IFD at the a  particular
              file  offset.   The  file offset may be specified
              using the usual C-style syntax;  i.e.  a  leading
              ``0x''  for  hexadecimal  and a leading ``0'' for
              octal.
